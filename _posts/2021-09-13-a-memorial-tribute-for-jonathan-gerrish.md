In late August, 2021, we were incredibly saddened to learn of the tragic
passing of Jonathan Gerrish and his family while they were hiking near
Mariposa, CA.  Jonathan was a long-time Robolectric maintainer and active
contributor since 2014.  He saw incredible potential in Robolectric and
championed it within Google, elevating it to an officially supported testing
tool that grew to be used by tens of thousands of Android developers.

The breadth of the contributions that Jonathan made to the project are too wide
to list in this post. He was involved in many high-profile projects such as
revamping PackageManager support and binary resources. He also worked
extensively to get first-class support for Robolectric in Gradle and Bazel.
Jonathan was passionate about continually improving the fidelity of Robolectric
to the point where write-once, run-everywhere was possible. This allowed the
same test to either be run in Robolectric or any physical or virtual Android
device.

More importantly, Jonathan had a great spirit and was beloved by friends and
family. He was friendly, easy-going, and respectful. He had a great love of the
outdoors and settled near Mariposa, CA to be closer to nature. While the
circumstances of Jonathanâ€™s passing are still under investigation, we would
like to urge people to be extra cautious when spending time outdoors,
especially in drought conditions.

We miss you dearly Jon. You will always be remembered by the Robolectric
community.
